    /*
    Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters.
    The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
    Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

    Input: s = "tree"
    Output: "eert"
    Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
    So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
